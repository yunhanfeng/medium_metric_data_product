# medium_metric_data_product
My first data product, providing data solution for Medium writer to track post performance

Medium is one of my favorite products in the world. However, it has some shortcomings of the analytics platform for writers which is too simple to extract more insights for furhter writing strategy.

I used simple exploratory analysis, PCA, clustering and parallel coordinates to provide writer communities the further recommendation for identify better metrics for usage and writers can expand influence by focusing on the popular articles type on their own Medium blog.

Feel free to check my [Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/user-guide-to-my-first-data-product-medium-post-metric-displayer-e99e74e52b3a) to see how I developed this product and you can download and use it for optimize your Medium blog in a more data-driven manner.
